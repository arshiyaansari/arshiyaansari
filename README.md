### Hi there 👋🏾  I'm Arshiya, and I'm passionate about creating an interdisciplinary impact with artificial intelligence!

🔭 I'm currently developing an LSTM network that models after the scale-invariant patterns of the brain's time cells for [my capstone project](https://github.com/gauvand/SIF_Capstone). 

🌱 I'm learning more on deep neural networks and convolution neural networks for the use case of autonomous systems.

⚡ Fun facts: I play the guitar, I longboard, and I know way too much about pop culture.
