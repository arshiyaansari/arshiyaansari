### Hi there 👋🏾  I'm Arshiya, and I'm passionate about creating an interdisciplinary impact with cloud computing and data science.

**arshiyaansari/arshiyaansari** is a ✨ _special_ ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

✨ I'm currently a machine learning engineer for the Special Projects Group at Apple.

🔭 Previously, I helped develop a LSTM network that models after the scale-invariant patterns of the brain's time cells for [my capstone project](https://github.com/gauvand/SIF_Capstone). 

🌱 I'm learning more about designing data-intensive systems and tools for autonomous use-cases.
