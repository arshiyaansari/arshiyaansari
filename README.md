### Hi there 👋🏾  I'm Arshiya, and I'm passionate about creating an interdisciplinary impact with artificial intelligence!

🔭 I'm currently developing an LSTM network that models after the scale-invariant patterns of the brain's time cells for [my capstone project](https://github.com/gauvand/SIF_Capstone). Our goal is to improve prediction accuracy of current BCI (Brain-Computer Interface) technology on EEG data by implementing neural features as artificial agents.

🌱 Learning more on deep neural networks and convolution neural networks for the use case of autonomous systems.
